TASK - 1 - Object detection with deep learning and OpenCV

With regards to deep learning-based object recognition there are three object detection methods that you'll probably experience:

1) Faster R-CNNs 

2) You Only Look Once (YOLO) 

3) Single Shot Detectors (SSDs) 

I opted yolo v3 algorithm for this project. this project contains also yolo v3 configuration files and yolo-v3-weight file 

the input and output images are present in this folder

Demo and output of the project - (Youtube - https://youtu.be/5i0ZM76OS5s)
